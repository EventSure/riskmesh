# Use the system rustc for build-script / proc-macro host compilation.
# The Solana platform-tools rustc (1.84.x) only ships BPF targets and
# cannot compile standard host crates out of the box.
# Cargo supports a per-host-target RUSTC override via:
#   CARGO_TARGET_<triple>_RUSTC = <path>
# But that env is not honoured by old cargo versions.
# The cargo-build-sbf wrapper removes the RUSTC env var, so we set
# the build-host linker wrapper here instead.
# For now, rely on the system default; this file exists to document the issue.
